# Tracker App

## Introduction

This is a containerized Golang app that can track and save incoming requests.

## Prerequisites

- Golang 1.20 version and greater
- PostgreSQL
- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Open Api v3

- This app includes openapi.yaml specification that you can use with [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io) copy and pase the spec to this web site to see all available endpoints and methods.

## Getting Started

NOTE! I strongly recommend you to run this app on MacBooks with M1, M2 etc. processor. Command for building and running application on other platform are not tested but they are defined in the project. If you will be able to run under other platform with some fixes I'm ready to REVIEW PULL REQUESTS.

For more details see corresponding titles for each command and step

## Build the project in one command

This command builds both the tracker and cancel-transaction-worker services for the specified platform linux/amd64 and tag latest.
It first runs the install, generate, test, buildx, and buildxworker commands.

```bash
make buildprojectx
```

## Stage by stage commands

1. Installing dependencies
2. Generating models from openapi.yaml
3. Testing the app
4. Building the app
    - Main service
    - Worker app
5. Running the App
6. Stopping the App

### Installing dependencies



```bash
make install
```

### Generating models from openapi.yaml

- First, run the following command to generate any necessary files:

```bash
make generate
```

### Testing the App

This command runs the go test command

```bash
make test
```

### Building the app

- We need to build 2 docker images to run it with docker-compose
1. Main service
2. Worker app

#### Main service

- for main tracker application which serves HTTP requests
- to make a request to service you can use openapi.yaml specification
- first create an account with specified balance
- then create a transactions with specified account id from 1st stage

```bash
make buildx
```

#### Worker app

- Post-processing worker
- every N minutes 10 latest odd records must be canceled and balance should be corrected by the application.
- by default N is set to 1 minute
- to set minutes go to cmd/cancel-transaction-worker/main.go where s.Every($minutes).Minute() $minutes to N

```bash
make buildxworker
```

### Running the App

- To launch, we need to run docker-compose, this will launch PostgreSQL database and apply migrations to start sending requests

```bash
make composeupx
```

### Stopping the App

- To stop, we need to run docker-compose, this will stop application and database

```bash
make composedownx
```

## Building the App

To build the app, run:

- For MacOS under M1, M2 processors (*tested on MacBook Air M2*)

```bash
make buildx
```

This will build a Docker image tagged tracker:latest based on the Dockerfile at docker/macos/arm64/Dockerfile.

- For other platforms (not tested due to lack of other platforms on hand)

```bash
make build
```

This will build a Docker image tagged tracker:latest based on the Dockerfile at docker/other/Dockerfile.

## Building the Worker

To build the worker, run:

- For MacOS under M1, M2 processors (*tested on MacBook Air M2*)

```bash
make buildxworker
```

This will build a Docker image tagged tracker:latest based on the Dockerfile at docker/macos/arm64/Dockerfile.

- For other platforms (not tested due to lack of other platforms on hand)

```bash
make buildworker
```

This will build a Docker image tagged tracker:latest based on the Dockerfile at docker/other/Dockerfile.

## Running the App without Database (see bellow to run with docker-compose that includes all dependencies)

To run the app, run:

Similar to previews commands
- For other platforms

```bash
make run
```

- For MacOS under M1, M2 processors (*tested on MacBook Air M2*)

```bash
make runx
```

This will start a Docker container running the tracker:latest image, which listens on port 8080.

## Using Docker Compose

If you have Docker Compose installed, you can use it to start the app and its dependencies using the following commands:

Similar to previews commands
- For other platforms

```bash
make composeup
```

- For MacOS under M1, M2 processors (*tested on MacBook Air M2*)

```bash
make composeupx
```

This will start the app and a PostgreSQL database container.

To stop the app and the database and application, run:

Similar to previews commands
- For other platforms

```bash
make composedown
```

- For MacOS under M1, M2 processors (*tested on MacBook Air M2*)

```bash
make composedownx
```

## Conclusion

That's it! You now have a containerized Golang app that can track and save incoming requests.
